# pofBeam


pofBeam is a Pof (see [https://github.com/Ant1r/ofxPof](https://github.com/Ant1r/ofxPof)) addon for drawing textured thick paths, for example to draw an oscilloscope-like beam.

The algorithm is simple enough to allow adding points at audio rate, which partly explains why it produces some wrong artifacts...
Which doesn't mean that it could not be improved!
